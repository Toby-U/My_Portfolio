                     Currently undergoing my Computer Science at the University of
                    Lancaster. I’ve been able to hone not just my technical and
                    analytical skills in software development principles, but also  my
                    communicational and interactive skills allowing me to easily both
                    develop and understand who or what I’m developing for. (I'm still
                    learning though, so can't say I'm perfect but we'll get there).
